                              <div class="static-text">DAU Events are the presentations of the DAU Project, a multimedia project that includes film, visual art, music, experiments, interactive and live performance. DAU Events allow you (the "Attendee," also referred to as the: "Visa Applicant" / "Visa Holder") to explore the DAU Project in its various forms.</div>
                              <div class="static-text">Attendees should be aware that their experience may include exposure to graphic scenes including extreme violence, scenes of a sexual nature, and scenes of an upsetting nature. Attendees will be invited to partake in unconventional experiences during their visit; they are entitled to refuse these invitations at all times. We therefore ask Visa Applicants to consider this information before participating in any DAU Event.</div>
                              <div class="static-text">To attend a DAU Event, Attendees are required to apply for an Entry Visa ("Visa"). By doing so, you agree to these terms and conditions.</div>
                              <div class="static-text">Any information provided as part of the Visa application process will be used by the Event Provider and their trusted creative partners to administer the DAU Event you are attending, and to provide you with information about other Events taking place as part of the DAU Project. More information about how we handle your Personal Data is available in our Privacy Policy. For further information, please follow a link DAU's Privacy Policy <a href="./privacy-en.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</div>

                                 <li class="static-list-item">Your Visa application will involve the creation of a personal profile, including a psychometric survey. The purpose of the profile is to enable our algorithmic system to tailor your DAU visit specifically to you. Your data will be kept confidential and will not be shared with any unauthorized third parties. To understand how we will use your personal information refer to our Privacy Policy</li>
                                 <li class="static-list-item">Your Visa identity card will be collected on the day of your arrival at the DAU territory. Arrival 30 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment is highly recommended.</li>

                                 <li class="static-list-item">Once inside the DAU Territory, you will be taking part in a new phase of an ongoing experiment that began in 2009 in DAU's secret research Institute. To find out more about the original experiment, click <a href="/about?locale=en_GB" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                                 <li class="static-list-item">Inside the DAU Territory, your experience will include the first ever screenings of DAU feature films. They depict unique personal stories gathered during the original DAU experiment. You will have the opportunity to see a few or all of the films, as well as participate in other experiences, which may be spiritual, intellectual, or artistic. The more you experience, the more profound your understanding of the DAU experiment will be. We suggest that you should set aside no less than 6-8 hours to begin to experience DAU. There are no shortcuts.</li>
                              </ul>

                                 <li class="static-list-item">Visas Applications processed via the Event Provider's website <a href="https://dau.com" target="_blank">www.dau.com</a>, are subject to these terms and conditions and are issued at the full discretion of the Event Provider.</li>
                                 <li class="static-list-item">Visa fees are inclusive of VAT</li>
                                 <li class="static-list-item">Where the Visa Information states that an age restriction applies to the DAU Event, the Event Provider will operate a strict ID policy. To gain access, the Visa holder must produce a valid form of photographic identification. Accepted forms of identification are Passports, National Identity Cards and Valid Driving Licenses. Please note that only original documents will be accepted as proof. Refunds will not be provided to those who are not admitted to the DAU Event as a result of failure to provide acceptable identification or who do not comply with the applicable age restriction.</li>
                                 <li class="static-list-item">Even in relation to tickets which are not subject to an age restriction (only K1 tickets), those under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult, and must have their parents' consent to attend the DAU Event and for their personal data to be collected. This adult is obliged to prevent all minors under their charge from accessing inappropriate content, and the visit of these minors is undertaken under the sole responsibility of the accompanying adult. Due to some of the graphic content of some of the films, no films will be available for those aged under 18 years old to watch (the K1 ticket doesn't permit access to any film). This content is not appropriate for minors and they are prohibited from accessing it, even if their accompanying adult thinks otherwise. If an accompanying adult ignores this instruction, we reserve the right to remove them and the minors under their charge from the premises. Finally, minors are not allowed to observe or take part in experiences at the DAU Event which are marked as prohibited to those under the age of 18. Furthermore, accompanying adults have the right to refuse to allow the minors under their charge to observe or take part in any experiences during their visit of the DAU Event if they consider that they are not appropriate. The decision to observe or take part in these experiences is the sole and entire responsibility of the accompanying adult.</li>
                                 <li class="static-list-item">Visas purchased will be available for collection at the DAU Event on the date of your visit, using the email confirmation provided at the time of online purchase.</li>

                                 <li class="static-list-item">No Refunds. All Visas are non-refundable except, subject to these terms and conditions, on cancellation of the DAU Event by the Event Provider. Visas cannot be exchanged or returned except in the case of manifest error by DAU Event Provider or at Event Provider's discretion. It is your responsibility to check that the information contained in the acknowledgement of your Visa is accurate. Visas may not be resold, reissued or transferred to any other person. Unauthorised resale (or attempted unlawful resale) of a Visa is grounds for seizure or cancellation of that Visa without refund or any other compensation.</li>
                                 <li class="static-list-item">DAU Event cancellation. In the unlikely event of Event Provider having to cancel a DAU Event partially or entirely due to licensing, or other legal restrictions, or for safety reasons, then Event Provider will provide notification of the cancellation via the email address provided by the Visa Applicant. On cancellation, Event Provider will offer Visa Holders the opportunity to either;</li>
                                 <li class="static-list-item">(i) exchange their Visas for entry to the DAU Event at a later date or an alternative DAU Event during the DAU Project (subject to availability);<br>Or<br>(ii) a refund equal to the total fees paid for the Visa. Refunds can only be claimed by emailing info@dau,com. Exchanges can be carried out by emailing info@dau.com, or at the visa centres.</li>
                                 <li class="static-list-item">This option must be exercised promptly and in any event within 2 weeks of notification by Event Provider of the cancellation. This is Event Provider's sole liability to Visa holders in the event of cancellation.</li>
                                 <li class="static-list-item">Disruption. No Visa exchanges or refunds will be given if the DAU Event, or the opening, or start of the DAU Event, is disrupted or delayed for reasons such as security alerts, traffic incidents, adverse weather conditions and strike action. The DAU Event will commence or continue as soon as the Event Provider is reasonably able to do so. Where the Booking Information states that the DAU Event will be held outdoors Attendees are expected to be prepared for inclement weather.</li>
